# System Design

## Learning Objective
By the end of this lesson, you will balance data, scale, reliability, security, and operations.

## What is System Design?
System design explains how a system meets functional and non-functional needs under real-world load and failure conditions.

## Why it is important?
At advanced level, documentation must guide decisions, not only describe screens. It should help teams understand tradeoffs, risks, module boundaries, performance, deployment, and long-term maintenance.

## ERP Example
Payroll generation uses queues and workers so large monthly processing does not block attendance or employee self-service.

## Step-by-step Explanation
1. Define scope and business capability.
2. Identify users, modules, data, integrations, and constraints.
3. Document the main design decisions and alternatives.
4. Add diagrams that show structure and behavior.
5. Review non-functional requirements such as security, scale, reliability, and operations.
6. Create an implementation checklist.

    E --> F[Review and Improve]
```

## Key Points
- Architecture is about tradeoffs.
- Advanced documents should include risks and assumptions.
- Module ownership prevents long-term confusion.
- Non-functional requirements must be explicit.

## Common Mistakes
- Creating diagrams without decision context.
- Ignoring operational concerns.
- Over-engineering before the business needs it.
- Copying architecture patterns without understanding cost.

## Practice Task
Create a two-page architecture note for System Design. Include problem, decision, diagram, risks, alternatives, and review checklist.

## Summary
System Design helps you move from feature documentation to architecture-level thinking.
