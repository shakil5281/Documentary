# Scalability Performance

## Learning Objective
By the end of this lesson, you will improve response time, throughput, and capacity through measurement and design.

## What is Scalability Performance?
Scalability is the ability to handle more load. Performance is how fast the system responds. Both require measurement before optimization.

## Why it is important?
At advanced level, documentation must guide decisions, not only describe screens. It should help teams understand tradeoffs, risks, module boundaries, performance, deployment, and long-term maintenance.

## ERP Example
ERP dashboards use cached summaries, while payroll batch jobs run in background workers with progress tracking.

## Step-by-step Explanation
1. Define scope and business capability.
2. Identify users, modules, data, integrations, and constraints.
3. Document the main design decisions and alternatives.
4. Add diagrams that show structure and behavior.
5. Review non-functional requirements such as security, scale, reliability, and operations.
6. Create an implementation checklist.

    E --> F[Review and Improve]
```

## Key Points
- Architecture is about tradeoffs.
- Advanced documents should include risks and assumptions.
- Module ownership prevents long-term confusion.
- Non-functional requirements must be explicit.

## Common Mistakes
- Creating diagrams without decision context.
- Ignoring operational concerns.
- Over-engineering before the business needs it.
- Copying architecture patterns without understanding cost.

## Practice Task
Create a two-page architecture note for Scalability Performance. Include problem, decision, diagram, risks, alternatives, and review checklist.

## Summary
Scalability Performance helps you move from feature documentation to architecture-level thinking.
